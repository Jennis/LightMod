# LightMod
LightMod is a simple but elegant flashlight app for iOS. Apple rejects this app since there are too many flashlight apps on App Store. I won't sacrifice the simplicity just for releasing it. So I opensource it. Feel free to use it.

Part of the codes is based on the sample code on PaintCode website.
